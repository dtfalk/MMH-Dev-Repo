        <!-- Description of the band -->
        <p>
          <strong>My Mom Is Here</strong> is a New York City-based band blending the soul of jazz with the accessibility of pop and the energy of classic rock. Formed by vocalist <strong>Samantha Seiff</strong> and pianist <strong>Nick Sare</strong>, the group features Columbia jazz alumni <strong>Aidan Speckhard</strong> (drums), <strong>Stephen Park</strong> (guitar), and <strong>Ryan Daar</strong> (bass).
        </p>
        <p>
          The band debuted in June 2024 with <em>“Didn’t Sleep Tonight”</em>, a soulful, groove-forward track inspired by a chaotic night out. The song was largely written by Seiff during a 6 a.m. Uber ride and built around a catchy bass riff composed by Sare—who is also a founding member of <em>Melt the Band</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing on influences like Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder, and Tedeschi Trucks Band, <strong>My Mom Is Here</strong> creates music that’s rich in texture, bold in ambition, and always danceable. Their sound wraps the expansive freedom of jazz and neo-soul in a polished, modern package.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their second single, <em>“Memory Jar,”</em> is set to release in August 2024.
